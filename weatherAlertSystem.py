# Project: Automated Weather Alert System
"""
Description: This project automates the process of checking the weather forecast for a specific location and sending weather alerts via email or text message if certain weather conditions are met.
It uses an external weather API to retrieve weather data and sends notifications to users based on their preferences.

Steps:

Choose a weather API service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and obtain an API key.
Write a Python script to interact with the weather API to fetch weather data for a specific location.
Implement logic to check weather conditions and decide whether to trigger an alert.
Set up a notification system to send alerts to users (via email or text message).
Requirements:

Python (installed on your system)
An API key from the chosen weather API service.
Knowledge of working with APIs, sending notifications, and handling data in Python.
Example Code (using OpenWeatherMap API and SMTP email for notifications):
